# Population/Temp/Light tracking 
This is where all our coding files are going to be stored for both lab and out of lab works.

If we want to try something out without messing up the main code, MAKE A NEW BRANCH FIRST.
This is important so we don't mess up the MAIN code, as the alternate branch will let us try stuff out first before we COMMIT our changes to the main one
